# *Discord Bot*

***

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a Discord bot with a wide range of functions, from writing in chat to playing music in voice chat. New features will be added over time (*I hope*).

***

## How to run this bot

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Enter your API keys and selected model into `.env` file
> [!NOTE]
> You need to generate your own API codes for both [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com)
>
> I'd recommend using `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` as a model

4. Run `python discord_bot.py`
5. Enjoy your own bot!
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This bot works as long as you don't turn off the code/console. It is not connected to any external server. Keep this in mind because sometimes you may accidentally turn it off.
